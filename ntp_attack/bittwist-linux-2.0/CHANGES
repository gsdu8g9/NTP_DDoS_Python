misc.
- Bit-Twist 0.72 for Windows has been released prior to this update

29/04/2006: Version 0.72
- removed definition of in_addr_t in def.h for BSD distribution
bittwistb (bridge)
- minor bug correction

28/04/2006: Version 0.71
bittwist (generator)
- removed maths.h which was previously required for round(),
  ROUND() is now defined in def.h
- minor bug correction
bittwistb (bridge)
- fixed gethwaddr(), previous version does not work under Linux

11/04/2006: Version 0.7
bittwistb (bridge)
- removed packet duplication check (based on resource hog MD5 hashing);
  this was initially required due to a faulty logic which causes the bridge
  to check and forward packets that are already departing from an interface
- added explicit check for broadcast and multicast packets
- added hash entry timeout check
bittwiste (editor)
- option -R range can take a single value, e.g. -R 10 instead of previous
  requirement of -R 10-10 to save only the 10th packet
- added support for checksum correction for payload which covers ICMP, TCP,
  or UDP header and data
- in def.h, #define IP_FO_MAX, 8191 changed to 7770
misc.
- created manpages for bittwist, bittwistb, bittwiste
- public release: http://bittwist.sourceforge.net

04/04/2006: Version 0.61
bittwistb (bridge)
- minor correction: when "forward to all", we are not suppose to forward a
  packet back into the same port where we received it

03/04/2006: Version 0.6
bittwistb (bridge)
- added pcap based program to bridge 2 or more LAN segments
bittwiste (editor)
- added proper handling for fragmented packets
- skip checksum calculation for fragmented packets
- option -R range is working now

17/03/2006: Version 0.5
bittwist (generator)
- removed option -e timeout presented in Version 0.4 since its usage
  is limited and we can do better by using the OS ping program
- added option -c count
  to send packets up to count
bittwiste (editor)
- full rewrite
- added options to edit most fields in Ethernet, ARP, IP, ICMP, TCP and UDP header
- added option -X payload
  to support addition of payload from standard input
- added option -L layer
  to support writing up to specific layer only
- added option -R range
  to support writing of specific packets only

10/03/2006: Version 0.4
- redundant definitions in bittwist.h and bittwiste.h moved to def.h
- change of datatype, e.g. unsigned char is now u_char
bittwist (generator)
- added option -e timeout
  to allow sending packet as ping packet and check for host response
  (currently limited to ICMP echo only, expect support for TCP in later version)
bittwiste (editor)
- added option -c
  to disable/enable checksum correction

25/02/2006: Version 0.3
bittwist (generator)
- added option -r linerate
  to limit packet throughput at the specified line rate (1 -> 1000Mbps)
- explicit close for pcap descriptor and file pointer removed from cleanup()
- more details in info()
bittwiste (editor)
- options to change source/destination MAC, source/destination IP, TTL,
  source/destination port, enable/disable checksum correction for
  IP, ICMP, TCP and UDP packets

21/02/2006: Version 0.2
- removes libnet dependency
- requires libpcap 0.9.4 (and above)
- options: -d, -vv, -i interface, -s len, -l loop, -m speed, -p sleep, -h
- -v for timestamp and -vv to include hex data
- user specified interval in seconds through -p option
- interval multiplier through -m option
- packet length:
  send captured length / on wire length / user specified length (14 to 1514 bytes)
  through option -s
- SIGINT signal handling

25/01/2006: Version 0.1
- skeleton program, uses libpcap 0.9.4 and libnet 1.1.3-RC-01
- options: -D, -V, -i interface, -l loop
- tested only on FreeBSD 6.0-STABLE
